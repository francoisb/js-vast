JS-VAST
=======

This is a Digital Video Ad Serving Template (VAST) client library in javascript.

To start using it, just download the file in the *build* folder (js-vast.js or js-vast.min.js) and add it to your project as a regular external js file (in that case it will be in the global variable windows['js-vast']), using CommonJS or AMD.
